# Bug-Tracker
I got the idea from a youtube video.
Ended doing it to added to my portfolio.
## you can now visit the app https://rodrigo-bug-tracker.herokuapp.com/
## You have access to demo Admin
## There is "Create Bug Tracker app" Project that is protected, you can not edit delete or add tickets, but you can add comments
## You also have access to administration that allows to edit user data but demo Admin has no access to edit data.
